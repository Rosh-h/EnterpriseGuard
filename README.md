EnterpriseGuard: Secure CRUD API Solution
EnterpriseGuard is a robust Spring Boot application that provides a secure CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API solution with JWT (JSON Web Token) Security for managing data within an enterprise environment.

Features
CRUD Operations: Perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on entities securely.
JWT Security: Secure API endpoints with JWT authentication and authorization.
Spring Data JPA: Simplifies data access with ORM capabilities for MySQL database interaction.
Spring Security: Ensures robust authentication and authorization mechanisms.
Spring Boot Actuator: Includes monitoring and management endpoints for operational insights.
Technologies Used
Spring Boot: Framework for creating scalable and efficient Spring applications.
Spring Data JPA: Implements ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) with MySQL for data persistence.
Spring Security: Provides comprehensive security features for protecting API endpoints.
MySQL: Relational database management system for storing and retrieving data.
JWT (JSON Web Tokens): Ensures secure transmission of information between parties.
Java 8+: Programming language for backend development.
Maven/Gradle: Build automation tools for managing dependencies and building the project.
Setup Instructions
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your/repository.git
cd enterprise-guard
Configure MySQL:

Create a MySQL database and update the application.properties file with your database configurations:
properties
Copy code
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_database
spring.datasource.username=your_username
spring.datasource.password=your_password
Run the application:

Using Maven:
bash
Copy code
mvn spring-boot:run
Using Gradle:
bash
Copy code
./gradlew bootRun
API Documentation:

Explore and test the API endpoints using tools like Postman or cURL:
Base URL: http://localhost:8080/api
Example endpoints:
GET /api/users: Retrieve all users
GET /api/users/{id}: Retrieve user by ID
POST /api/users: Create a new user
PUT /api/users/{id}: Update an existing user
DELETE /api/users/{id}: Delete user by ID
Authentication:

Obtain a JWT token for accessing secured endpoints:
Send a POST request to /authenticate with credentials (username/password) to receive a JWT token.
Include the JWT token in the Authorization header as Bearer <token> for accessing secured API endpoints.
Additional Notes
Customize the project according to enterprise-specific requirements and business logic.
Ensure proper security configurations and environment-specific settings for production deployment.
For scalability, consider containerization with Docker and deployment on cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure.
